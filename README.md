[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/pagarme/pagarme-php.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/pagarme/pagarme-php)

## Observation

Since [Release v3.0](https://github.com/pagarme/pagarme-php/releases/tag/v3.0), the current version on branch `master` is considered **DEPRECATED**, which means:

- For the branch `master`, we only support changes for critical bug fixes;
- New features should not be created/designed with this version in mind;
- This version is **only** recommended for applications using PHP 5.3.*.

We strongly encourage you to use the `V3` version, and you can check the latest stable releases [here](https://github.com/pagarme/pagarme-php/releases).

## Support
